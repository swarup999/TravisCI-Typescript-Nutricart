# NutriCart

In the busy modern lives of young adults, it is not always easy or convenient to maintain a healthy and nutritious diet.


With the rise of online grocery shopping, we wanted to create a tool that empowers users to make informed nutritional choices effortlessly.

We introduce **NutriCart** -  your online grocery companion. Helping you balance health and convenience in every click, by seamlessly tracking calories, protein, fibre and more!

Currently, NutriCart is available for Instacart
(https://www.instacart.ca).
